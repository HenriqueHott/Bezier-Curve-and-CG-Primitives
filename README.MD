Bezier Curve and CG Primitives 
=======
Description
------------


My goal with this repository is to help students better understand some known computer graphics algorithms and provide a simple and intuitive interface to test and understand them.

The implementation was created with the help of the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.  

The interface was created with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
